# FriendFinder

This application is inspired by dating apps. 
Essentially it is a full stack site that:
  Takes in results from a useer survey 
  Compares answers with other users 
  Then returns the name and picture of the user with the best overall match

This application uses Express to handle routing 
and is deployed to Heroku for testing.
